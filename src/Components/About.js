          <p style={{maxWidth: 700,textAlign:'justify', margin:'auto'}}>A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion. The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with appearance originally being tied to function.</p>
          <p style={{maxWidth: 700,textAlign:'justify', margin:'auto'}}>The Santos Tour Down Under inspires us all by kicking-off the new racing season, so we’re bringing you a new S-works 7 shoe, inspired by the Australian Budgie. Flocks of blue, green, and yellow that echo the peloton itself, manifest in the best race shoe ever made, the S-Works 7. This limited colourway, like the bird itself, will move fast, so don’t miss out. What makes the perfect cycling shoe? Is it exceptional power transfer? Superior Comfort? Undeniable style? The simple answer is “Yes,” to all of the above. With the S-Works 7 Road shoe, you get high-performance shoes with no compromises.</p>
